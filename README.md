#Portfolio page

This is my portfolio page that is being displayed on github.io.  I wanted to have some practical front end work since I mostly focused on back end development.  I originally did the portfolio in another repo (coincidentally called portfolio ;) ) to be hosted elsewhere but I realized that Github provided a way to host sites so I moved my development of my portfolio page to this repo instead.  I'll keep the previous repo for reference since there were quite a few commits.  

The site is not yet responsive but I'm going to have it responsive.  Currently, the content provided is based on my current CV/Resume.  I am going to add hobbies/interests and some projects that I have worked on in my previous employment.  

Stuff that I wanna do to the site:

1.  Add responsiveness to the site
2.  I want to add content for hobbies/interests and previous relevant projects to development
3.  Maybe some more job history since I have space for it
4.  I really wanted to get the nav bar to hide and display when scrolling down
5.  Animation for the social media links which is why there's animation in the css
6.  Maybe some animation for the work experience?
